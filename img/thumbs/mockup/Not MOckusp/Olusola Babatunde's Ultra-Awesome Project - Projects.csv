Balloon Grid,balloon-grid,"Modern architecture has been moving away from concrete buildings due to high expences associated with complex designs. However, since most of the cost for a building comes from the labors developing it, we decided to create a press that could simplify the process of making concrete roofs. So we developed a multipoint actuator to simplify the process of making presses for the concrete. That way, instead of wasting thousands of dollars on wood and materials to build frames, our Balloon Grid press can form them with a single person. If you would like to speak about this project more, please reach out to me since I can't say too much publicly.

Cryptaceous Creations,cryptaceous-creations,"Say hello to the world's first ever educational Blockchain based AR Game! Wow that's a mouth full. Hong Kong was looking for ways to teach kids about Blockchain, so we developed a mobile fossil hunting game that created uniquly colored dineosours to teach the fundmanetals of how to use Blockchain. ",June 2018 - August 2018,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c301858edb5fd5c2cb0e252/5c32aa92cb585f687546efd8_Creations%203.png,Screenshot of Nifty Hackathon ,"<h2>Inspiration</h2><p>Me and my teammates, despite being collegiate students, all agree that we are very childish. We love watching childish shows, playing novel games, and randomly singing Disney songs. So when we saw a hackathon with an open ended need statement, we knew this was a perfect time to appeal to kids around our age. . . or at least . . . our mental age. So we decided that we would make a dinosaur game because a lot of kids where we are from all seem to like dinosaur related games and toys. That way, by using a pre-existing icon that kids enjoy, we knew if we made a dinosaur centric blockchain game, we could inform members of the next generation about the basic concepts of Ethereum by giving them a chance to use NFT Tokens early on. </p><h2>What it does</h2><p>This is a mobile game that implements blockchain systematic to create a collecting, trading, and battling environment with Unity and Remix software. The game focuses on hunting for fossils in AR, collecting them, synthesizing dinosaurs from the fossils, and battling, selling, and trading the synthesized creatures. Dinosaurs and fossils will be kept track of using blockchain system in a characters inventory as well as purchase other dinosaurs and fossils with tokens earned though the game. &nbsp;</p><h2>How we built it</h2><p>Since this game is targeted toward the next generation of mobile gamer, our project needed to have a strong, modern user interface. So, by using Unity and Vuforia, we developed an Augmented Reality mobile game that would work off of cameras of the user. In order to make an interactive program like this, we had to use C# scripts in addition to 3D Modeling (like with Blender) to develop our 3D Parts </p><h2>Challenges we ran into</h2><p>From the back-end development, the main challenge is integrating between unity and block chain. This is due to lack of knowledge of developer on writing C# and NEthereum.At the end, back-end we only build the marketplace with the integration of unity and block chain for the future.</p><p>From the front-end, we knew we needed to focus on the User Interface and simplifying the User Experience in order to get kids to not only be interested int he game, but also keep playing it. Developing the unique color schemes and C# scripts needed for Unity and Affinity Photo was more time consuming then we planned for . Fortunately, by simplifying our C# scripts, we saved a lot of debugging time the Unity Objects. &nbsp;</p><p>But from a personal perspective, we mainly struggled with our lives outside of the hackathon. Two of our members had exams the next morning, so we had to finish the project before they had to go to class. And three of our members were all first year university students, each from different countries, with common misunderstands that came from speaking English with working together. </p><h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2><p>We are proud of how, despite the issues, we encountered within the 20 hours, we were still able to produce a cool working AR game! We we able to complete a functional prototype of our app as well as learn to over common communication issues to complete a common goal. </p><h2>What we learned</h2><p>During this project, we learned not only about how difficult it is to connect Blockchain to Unity and mobile apps, but also how difficult it is to work with Augmented reality as well. A prerequisite for our project seemed to have been an extensive understanding of how to write C# scripts and model special tokens with variable changing colors. &nbsp;While their was a steep learning curve for the past 18 hours, we learned how to control 3D objects, use C# logic in practice, and apply the engineering design process to a very vague problem. </p><h2>What's next for Cryptaceous Creations</h2><ul><li>Full integration of unity with Ethereum specifically on digital asset i.e. dinosaurs and gems. </li><li>Digital assets on market place utilizing maybe 0x.</li><li>GPS based on the user interface. </li><li>Complete the Battle Game Play. </li></ul><p>‚Äç</p>",Product / Designer Manager and Developer,"Unity, Video Production, Mandarin(Elementary), C#, Canva, Empathy, and Redbull ",https://vimeo.com/309192835/settings,,Hackathon Entry,,,5,,,,,,,,

VestaGoGo,vestagogo,"Navigation can be difficult when their are many things you need to keep your eyes and ears aware of. So we developed a mobile haptic vest and navigation system to allow people to navigate from place to place without obsturcting their sight or hearing. Tools Used: Noodl (Framework), Figma, Andriod Studio (Java), Usablitity testing, and Ardunio.",August 2018 - Present,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c301858edb5fd5c2cb0e252/5c32b16e121342e42403fe31_Fema.png,VestaGoGo Screenshots of usage,"<p>team worked on redesign the interface of the Taktigo Vest application in a </p><p>way that make everyday use easier and more fluid for blind or visually challenged individuals. </p><p>Our initial goal this semester was to redesign the TaktiGo app and make the user interface </p><p>friendlier for our target users. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>We had some setbacks in using android studios, troubleshooting the convoluted existing code, </p><p>and obtaining a proper API key. In addition, Noodl is a program that only allowed us to design a </p><p>prototype, which hindered our ability to add the audio features of the app. Given that we decided </p><p>to use Noodl during the middle of the semester, the time we spent learning to use it left only a </p><p>few weeks to design an app. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>We made a prototype of using Noodl to design and model our concepts for an easy to navigate </p><p>interface. Our prototype utilizes contrasting colors for the buttons to make each button and its </p><p>use easy to identify. &nbsp;New users can select a series of preferences when they set up the app for </p><p>the first time, such as audio preference and voice input settings. This allows the app to be </p><p>personalize and accessible to people with different levels of visual ability. Then the user clicks </p><p>‚ÄúBack to Home‚Äù and accesses the app as a returning user with their personalized settings </p><p>implemented. &nbsp; </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Initial interface design &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Overview of interface functions &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Introduction screen where users choose between New or Returning User </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Overview of interface functions &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>New User can choose personalized settings </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Navigation interface </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Root page organizer </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We recorded a video to submit to TAMU‚Äôs Virtual Project Showcase this semester as well to </p><p>represent Aggie Challenge. The video demonstrates the abilities and features of the vest and </p><p>includes interviews from each of the team members talking about an aspect of the project, such </p><p>as the code, the vest, the user interface, features of the app, and the origin of the project. &nbsp;It was </p><p>written and directed by Sola and edited by Audrey. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>Sole‚Äôs Main role was as the co-product manager. This role in this project didn‚Äôt just focus on </p><p>redesigning the apps user interface, but also altering the program to incorporate a simplified user </p><p>testing method. I focused on using 2 main programs to design my prototypes: Android Studio </p><p>and Sigma. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>With Sigma, we developed a prototype that was tested by students in the Paths program with </p><p>visual disabilities that they could interact with. During this phase, we were simply gaining casual </p><p>opinions on how they presently navigate campus and if they had any issues with the current </p><p>methods available. It was common for students to use walking canes and the strategically placed </p><p>windchimes to navigate campus because using mobile apps such as Google maps are normally </p><p>unintuitive and require assistance to translate road directions into walking maps. So, the first </p><p>Fina Design was designed as seen below. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The idea behind this design was a user could create routes that they though were self-effective </p><p>for them personally. So, by having someone tap the listening icon, they could state a route that </p><p>they planned on taking such as ‚ÄúStudent Computing Center to Memorial Student Center‚Äù and </p><p>then record their GPAs coordinates as they are taking their preferred route. Then they would </p><p>navigate as normal. That way, if they were traveling to a new location, such as ‚ÄúHEB to the </p><p>Memorial student Center‚Äù, the app would do its best to get the user onto the closest route that the </p><p>user has already prerecorded. And obviously, the addition of the vest would simplify directions. </p><p>While this would be simple to implement into a C# program, we needed to do a lot of research </p><p>on APIs for speech recognition, GPS logging, and route recalculation. Due to time constraints </p><p>and the goal of making a testable prototype, this idea needed to be put down. &nbsp;This semester at </p><p>least. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Our following Sigma Design was much simpler and easy to implement into Android studio </p><p>without altering the main functionality of the app. We focused on making touch regions on the </p><p>phone to control buttons instead of using small buttons like the app currently has. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>The idea behind this design was to create transparent buttons in Android studio that allowed </p><p>people to operate the app based on muscle memory with regions and a low required amount of </p><p>precision. Touching the map once will freeze the app and provide only directions while touching </p><p>it twice will cause navigation to begin. The user will be noted what street they are on and when </p><p>as well. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>After agreeing on testing this prototype, I developed the Java and JavaScript equivalences for the </p><p>program. All that was left was to implement it into Noodl and learn the MQRT system. </p><p>However, due to time, we were unable to complete this last part. However, this design can still </p><p>have the icons developed and invisible button system added to the main program. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>Future for this project would include user studies to test the features and functions of the new </p><p>app design. Feedback about the design would allow us to consider which features are working, </p><p>and which may be missing. We would also add audio aspects for our completely blind users. We </p><p>designed the app to be able to be used with simple audio cues. For example, ‚ÄúClick the top </p><p>portion of your screen if you are a new user or click the bottom portion of your screen if you are </p><p>a returning user.‚Äù After receiving enough user input to determine the optimal UI to assist those </p><p>that are visually impaired, our next step would be to implement the UI with the google map API </p><p>and the vest to create an app that can guide the visually impaired.</p><p>‚Äç</p>",Product Designer ," Noodl (Framework), Figma, Andriod Studio (Java), Usablitity testing, and Ardunio.
