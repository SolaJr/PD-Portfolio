												Introduction to Facebook 
												Fundraising? <br><br><br>
												Internship Overview<br>The 
												structure of my internship at 
												Facebook was split into 2 main 
												parts. The first being a 2 week 
												training program to learn 
												fundamental design tools like 
												origami, framer, and sketch, 
												while also learning design 
												considerations like Accessiblity 
												and language differences. The 
												second involved me spending 6 
												weeks on working on a top secret 
												Facebook tool. The detials can 
												be found in Facebook Internal 
												Tools. This project was a result 
												of an application of the 2 weeks 
												of training.<br><br>I also 
												worked on a side project called 
												Facebook blind dating and 
												pitched it to Facebook's dating 
												team.&nbsp; <br><br>Project 
												Overview <br>My project was to 
												improve the current Facebook 
												Fundraising system to convince 
												users to give more to 
												non-profits.&nbsp; During my 2 
												weeks I spent one learning the 
												fundamentals&nbsp; of the tools 
												I'd be using like Keynote and 
												Sketch, and spent the other week 
												conducting research and getting 
												data about Facebook Fundraising 
												Usage.&nbsp; I then iterated 
												designs to modify currently 
												exisiting features and conducted 
												user testing to calidate my 
												prototype designs and deliver 
												design concepts to the my soon 
												to be managers and fellow 
												interns. </td>

												<h4>The Opportunity and User 
												Insights</h4>
												</td>
												<td class="auto-style2" valign="top">
												The main trend I saw after 
												analyzing the data is most users 
												do read about causes on 
												fundraising profiles and often 
												do post on times lines for 
												people's birthdays. <br><br>This 
												means birthday fundraisers have 
												the potential to get a lot of 
												traffic to specific non-profits. 
												But what if that traffic, could 
												be monitized? <br><br>I decided 
												to make a system where if a 
												Facebook user views and posts on 
												a friend's time line while they 
												are hosting a birthday 
												fundriaser, they will also view 
												a pay per view advertisement. 
												Then a portion of that ad 
												revenue would be sent to the 
												non-profit organization to raise 
												them more money as a donation 
												for a certain birthday's 
												campaign. <br><br>After talking 
												to the Fundraising team, I 
												learned this system could work, 
												but the biggest issue was the 
												transaction fees and the taxes 
												involved for every single view 
												an ad would get. <br><br>As far 
												as the taxes go, non-profits are 
												tax exempted so most of the fees 
												can be reduced. However, this 
												doesn't work on personal causes 
												yet. <br><br>The transaction 
												fees could be avoided by making 
												a minimum required donation 
												raised amount to minimized the 
												amount of money lost. (For 
												example, if you raise $200 from 
												400 people with $0.15 
												transaction fees( or $60 in fees 
												) , then the non-profit will get 
												$140 from those views. However, 
												if $50 was raised with the same 
												group of people and same fees, 
												then the money won't be raised 
												for an individual and the total 
												amount earned would be sent the 
												non-profit directly since their 
												is only one transaction fee 
												associated in that case for the 
												total amount. <br><br>This 
												system helps :<br>- Users make 
												donations without the long 
												process of input card 
												information<br><br>By : <br>- 
												Minimizing the steps a user goes 
												though to make a small donation
												<br><br>And it is an improvement 
												because: <br>- It undeniably 
												increases the maximum amount of 
												money a non-profit recieves from 
												fundraising.&nbsp; <br>- It can 
												also be added simply into the 
												currently existing Facebook 
												System.&nbsp; </td>

					<p>I... I can't really sugar coat this too much but my

					learned how to use the Sketch and Proton tool to build UIs 
					and prototypes, but I still need to learn more about layout 
					and typography and presenting information strategically. If

					<p>Interaction design was really hard on this project. I was 
					essentially building a new experience for both desktop and 
					mobile devices and I wanted to make sure that my solution 
					was reverse compatible in terms of interaction. I got to 
					work with people swiping, scrolling and taping to find 
					solutions. I also learned how to work with multiple user

					<p>Facebook has a currently existing fundraising function, 
					but I wanted to create something different from their 
					Fundraising center and built my own Donation Center. The 
					main benefit for this was that I could illustrate the 
					concept of user's choosing if they want to opt into this new 
					design. It was intentionally designed to test if users would 
					likely click on the new feature in a familiar environment. 
					Perfect for user testing. In the future, I should plan for 
					my prototypes to be used for testing at first. </p>

					<p>One of the Facebook Fundraising team's goals is to 
					increase the amount of donations non-profits receive. So I 
					made this method because it would actually scale up the 
					maximum amount that non-profit could earn dramatically based 
					on the number of people who view each organization. So best 
					case scenario : we raise more money; worst case scenario; 
					worst case scenario : we make a little. But at the end of 
					the day, money will be earned for these causes. </p>

					<p>I took steps to learn new tools like sketch and proton on

					<p>By the end of the project, I knew I still had a lot of

					above. I most urgently need assistance on my visual design 
					since my engineering brain has trained me to build good, 
					functional, efficient designs, but not necessarily visually 
					appealing. I am working on this by taking personal design 
					classes in my free time. </p>
