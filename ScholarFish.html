 <p>Role - Lead Developer</p>
<p>Client - Garland High School Student Body  </p>
<p>Time - August 2013 to July 2017 </p>
<p>Tools -  Eclipse, ANdriod Studio, Google Sheets, Macros, Python</p>
<p>Brief -  Scholarfish is a computer program that was designed to help high schoolers identify scholarships that they had a strong chance of winning based on their academic status.  </p>
<p>Need Statement - How can we connect students to resources to get a full ride to college regardless of academic performance or personally connections?  </p>their academic status.  </p>
<p>Side note - 89% of students who used this app have taken $0 student loans. And none have taken more then 10k in student loans. </p><<img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c33d19a95aba26c13e43ac9/5c356e031f315a5ee47c2bde_Texas.png">
			
			<h2> Purpose</h2>
			<p>This app was designed initially to inform students about financial opportunities in for attending University for minimal costs. This ranged from how some schools like PVAMU had an Aggie Assurance policy to pay for student tuitions or how the University of Hawaii Manoa held a policy to help out of state students exempt room and board. The goal was to connect people initially to these opportunities. </p>
			<p>Once a student entered their data, they would be given a list of scholarships they automatically qualify for as well as some local scholarships that they qualify for. A PDF is generated for each student as shown below of certain rules or schools that awards must be distributed to if won. The app was designed to include automatic full rides such as Parieview A&M’s Full tuition scholarship was a 21 on the ACT and a GPA of 3.25 GPA. That way since 21 ACT is the top 40%, nearly any students should be able to use the app and its benefits. They were also given a custome made .Csv or .xls file that would help them manage which local scholarships to apply to in a regular amount of time. It also predicted how to prioritize scholarship and which scholarships were truly valuable.</p>

			<h2> Reflection</h2>
<p>This app was my very first major coding assignment and it taught me the raw power of coding. The main lesson I learned though was that even though this app was EXTREMELY effective, it was hard to get very many people to try it. This came down to how complicated the information I was displaying was. My friends all found the system easy to use, but this app wasn’t designed for people uneducated in basic tools such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets or for people that didn’t hold a computer in their home.

My biggest mistake with this term and this project was the fact I didn‘t design a solution that was made for my target audience. From this app forward, I was sure to always design my products with a user in mind.

This app will NOT be downloadable. The application is only effective if it is used by Garland High School Students only. But I do encourage people in other cities to create their own versions. If you would like my help on starting your own app for your city/school I can give you my experience and documentation as well as help you find the first 100 scholarships personally! I have helped 8 schools so far create their own programs. You can get it from me by contacting me .</p>
