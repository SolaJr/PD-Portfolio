      <p class="paragraph"><strong>Role </strong>: UX Designer<br><strong>Client </strong>: Myself<br><strong>Time </strong>: December 2018<br><br>An attempt to test the skills I&#x27;ve been developing on Figma and Canva, I make chose to redesign Facebook Local. <br><br><strong>Overview<br></strong>Facebook local is a mobile social media app that allows users to find Facebook events occurring near the user. While this app has the potential to provide people with spontaneous outings, access to unknown events and plan an event solely from their cell phone, it doesn’t seem to be getting the kind of popularity one would expect. While it is difficult to compare the main mobile Facebook app (which holds ~90 million reviews on the Google Play Store) to its partner apps such as Facebook Messenger(which holds ~62 million reviews on the Google Play Store), apps like Facebook Local are nearly unheard of (with only ~10,000 Reviews on the Google Play Store). It is shocking to see that such a useful app is being ignored by the general public, so I am going to try to find a potential reason.  A Case Study on my findings during a 48-hour design challenge. I decided to analyze an app that presently existed but didn&#x27;t hold more than 10k reviews on the Google Play Store. I chose this because reviews are often written when someone has an extremely good or bad experience using an app. And on average only 15% of the people that download an app will leave a review without a special reason. Therefore, if an app had a very low number of reviews, it could mean that the app could have room for revision or another app on the market fill the app&#x27;s niche better. I ultimately was surprised when I discovered how Facebook Local only had about 9K reviews on it when its parent and sibling apps such as Facebook Messenger held millions of reviews. So, I decided to dive in and learn as much as I could about the interface associated with Facebook Local.<br><br>Design Process<strong><br><br></strong><span><em>Purpose of the project</em></span><strong><em> </em></strong>- To learn what could improve the number of people using Facebook Local and get a larger number of reviews. <br><br><em>Objective </em>- I needed to develop: <br> - A wireframe that worked just like Facebook Local <br> - Conduct research on negative reviews<br> - Create a second wireframe using the results from the research. <br><br><em>Approach</em> - I decided to go through my design process the way I have on my previous projects: <br> - Learn<br> - Explore<br> - Select<br> - Develop<br> - Refine<br> - Deliver<br><br><strong>USERS </strong><br>Now, as expected, this app is meant to be used directly in conjunction with Facebook. So, the app relies heavily on people informing people of Local events based on their interests and liked groups. However, despite the app covering many potential needs of a user, it does have the ability to overwhelm a user. For instance, after surveying some engineering students, I learned many students cannot keep their main Facebook app&#x27;s notifications on because they know they will get sucked into seeing live feed and updates and stories that they would rather see later. <br><br>This fear of viewing certain notifications prevents them from seeing all possible notifications such as local events occurring in one&#x27;s neighborhood. This means that the main people that would use an app like Facebook local are the people that would also not want to view every single notification that comes through as it comes through. This type of app could be useful to everyone with access to Facebook. Whether it be people who work at a desk all day or students that need to prevent procrastination. The target audience for this app could possibly be any person that wants to be involved in their community but is also too busy to view every Facebook notification. <br><br>During my survey, I found a few additional answers, but for the focus of this 48-hour challenge, this will be the main group I will be targeting: busy young adults and adolescents that use Facebook regularly. <br><br><strong>APP <br></strong>So, it is possible that Facebook developed this app fully aware of that issue. After all, it would be an effective way to get people to stay on Facebook even if they can&#x27;t spend the time or phone space to use the entire app. But no matter the reason, let&#x27;s discuss the purpose of the app. Its main functions are it has all the capabilities of Facebook&#x27;s events pages but all on a mobile device. <br><br>Every function and feature that events on Facebook have can be found here. It allows users to see which of their friends are going to a certain event, display interests in possible events, and ultimately discover new events. For the purpose of these 48 hours,<strong> these are the functions I will focus on</strong>. Normally I would also compare Facebook Local to apps that perform similar functions. But due to the complexity and potential time commitment required to look at apps like Google&#x27;s Places and Yelp, I excluded them from this 48-hour challenge.<br><strong><br>Analyzing User Feedback <br>‍</strong>So, I looked for some user feedback that could be remedied by some beneficial product design alterations. Now some of the complaints about the project were somewhat in addressable for this challenge. For instance, several people didn’t like how they couldn’t find any events in certain rural towns located on the side of a mountain while and others had issues with the app crashing and going slow. Without knowing the nature of the events in every given area or the code bank of the app, I am incapable of making an improved product on those two fronts. But there were some reviews that were common that I thought were very fixable within a 48 hour period.<br></p>

That is because some reviewers love how Facebook local tells them what is happening in their community. And since one of the biggest benefits is discovering events, developing a mysterious persona may stand out more to an audience and make them more open to the idea of trying events they didn&#x27;t initially know about. <br></p>

            <p class="paragraph-4">Some of the reviews pointed out how they uninstalled the app extremely close to them when they installed it. That means that we only have a short amount of time for people to try this app before running back to the original product. So the first thing that should be changed is the title screen. I wish that this app had a title screen or a loading screen to help preclude the apps function while it’s gathering data instead of showing the signature place marker icon. It is so common with competitors different loading screen may give it a different vibe within the first few minutes of usage. That way users feel more invested in the app and find it more difficult to part with it so soon.<br><br>I chose a white background with a blue highlight for my color scheme since it has a slight remembrance of Facebook’s color scheme while lacking the sharp edges associated with the main Facebook Apps. And since fades in color make images seem more welcoming on time tested art, so it seemed like an appropriate introduction to the main app.(https: / / cen.acs.org/ articles/ 9 4/ i5/ Van-Goghs-Fading-ColorsInspire.html )<br><br><strong>TAKES TOO LONG TO SCROLL DOWN FOR RELEVANT EVENTS. <br></strong>If people think something takes too long, it may be better to play with the way they use time in the app.Streak<br>· Create a streak system! Like going to a Health event once a week or a visit a convention once a year. While this won’t get everyone in the Facebook community involved, the ability to overcome something with someone else is a valid reason to get people to spread the word of this app’s existence (https: / / blog.stormid.com/ the-psychology-of-sharing/ ). Kinda like Pokemon Go with the Team Gym Battle System.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-5"><br>· Possibly a System for how many events you go to with a certain friend may be a method. A more practical solution is to make it so the app can also highlight if certain friends will arrive at certain events. This system is more simple then the streak system but basically, all it does is create a highlight for each person that has been to 5+ events with another app user. That way, people will be less likely to uninstall the app if they see that their actions are earning them some type of reward. It may even motivate people to go out on days they didn&#x27;t plan to just to keep their streak. But this won&#x27;t always be effective. After all, if you are going to an event that has 10 of your Facebook friends, you may not care unless one of them is one of your closest friends. A streak with a stranger isn&#x27;t as rewarding as a streak with a close friend. This perk would be something that the present Facebook Event system is lacking, and it could be beneficial to this app.<br><br>The mock up on the left has blue highlights around friends you currently hold a streak with.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-7"><strong>Reflection<br></strong>1) As a programmer, I understand that NONE of the changes I have suggested are very“simple” or easy to make. Anyone can be an anonymous critic, but the true critics are the ones that analyze e the beauty of the program that was developed. I will remember this because I personally found the user design of Facebook Local as an aspiration to my goals as a designer more than an assist in finding events locally.  <br>‍<br>2) As an engineer, I know that many of these complaints aren’t “quantifiable” as designer requirements. So, I will be sure to always take my project guidelines and q quantify them from the get-go to give me some type of goal to aim for as I design.  <br><br>3) As a designer, I must say this app was developed beautifully! Honestly, this was pretty difficult at the start because I really fell in love with the transitions and options and intuitive nature the app had for connecting me to events I had never heard of. This entire piece was just my approach to tackling some of the issues shown by the reviewers. My biggest lesson from this project is to remember to focus on what we have to work with. I know we ignored other competitors for the sake of the 48 hours but analyzing their products would reveal some of the things I had suggested. I will remember to view competitors the next time I design a product from the idea phase. That way I can exploit and prevent the negative issues that our competitors have with our project.
