      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>Walking in the rain in the dark can be both scary and unpleasant. Umbrellas may shield people from the rain, but they lack the ability to light up the surrounding environment when necessary. In addition, umbrellas are generally useless as a tool to indicate the extent it is raining.</p>
      <p>There were a few changes we made from the Instructables model. One of the first changes we made was redesigning the breadboard design. While the instructions suggested that it was possible to use a breadboard to model their circuit, in practice, we found it difficult to debug and flimsy. The article actually uses PCB board. Instead, we chose to change this aspect of the design to be more durable by incorporating less wires. While we made enough piezo circuits to track each panel, we decided to only measure one panel in order to minimize the amount of damage possible.</p>
      <p>The second major change we did was 3D printing a case for the Arduino. One major flaw of the original design was that the electronics were largely held up by the umbrella fabric itself. This makes the umbrella heavily, lopsided, and rather delicate. The 3D printed case is easily attached/removed from the umbrella pole.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h4>Supplies</h4>
      <p>We made a list of supplies that included the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>1 Arduino Uno</li>
        <li>1 3.3k Ohm resistor (for LEDs)</li>
        <li>1 1M Ohm resistor (at least 1)</li>
        <li>Plenty of wire (non-fraying wire is preferred, although used a lot of fraying wire)</li>
        <li>Soldering iron</li>
        <li>Solder</li>
        <li>Umbrella (preferably non-segmented)</li>
        <li>Duck tape</li>
        <li>3D printer</li>
        <li>Super glue</li>
        <li>9V battery</li>
        <li>LEDs (at least 12)</li>
        <li>Piezo sensors (at least 1)</li>
        <li>1 breadboard<br></li>
      </ol>
      <h4>How to customize formatting for each rich text</h4>
      <p>To create an array of lights for the umbrella, we organized the lights into triangles. They were hooked up in series-parallel format. In addition, the light triangles were organized in parallel. This allowed us to continue to use the 5V output of the Arduino to power the entire umbrella. We soldered all of these connections within each triangle as well as between the various triangles to ensure stability.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>We made each triangle roughly the size each subsection of the umbrella. These triangles were glued (using super-glue) to the umbrella. We found it helpful to place tape (in our case, duct tape) over the LEDs as the glue dries and then remove them later. This creates a clean look and also leads to a more stable design. These triangles were resistant to the closing motion of the umbrella. We filled up four of the eight subsections with triangles. The 3.3 kOhm resistor should probably be a resistor with a lower resistance. Because of our redesign, we chose a resistor on-hand that wouldn’t likely cause the LEDs to burn out.</p>
      <p>The connection wires between triangles were difficult to set up because they involved placing longer wires and soldering them to a common location. This can obstruct the umbrella’s closing motion, so we suggest measuring the lengths of these connections and adding some extra distance for slack.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h2>Building the piezo circuits</h2>
      <h4><br></h4>
      <p>The piezo circuits are built according to the diagram below. We solder the two ends (signal and ground) of the piezo sensor to a 1 M Ohm resistor.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>Warning: We found that piezo sensors present some problems with normalizing the input values. In particular, pouring water on the umbrella may not activate the sensors after a certain amount of time.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h4>How to customize </h4>
      <p>Code functions is described as follows. When the program begins, in function setup(), the Serial port is opened at baud rate 9600. Digital Arduino pins are registered as outputs to control the lights. In the main loop function, three actions occur. The Piezo disk is read and if it’s threshold exceeds a certain value, then the lighting is turned on. The code is displayed in my github<br></p>
