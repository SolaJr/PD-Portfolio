The goal was to connect people initially to these opportunities. </div>

Their were 3 main ways I could get someone to go to college for free in Texas that I chose to focus on. <br>-       Merit awards<br>-       Financial Aid Awards<br>-       Guaranteed tuition free online universities. <br><br>First, I compiled a list of free tuition awards in the state of Texas based on Financial Need. This list had free schools for any family that made under $100k as their net family income.<br><br>Then I made a little bit of extra insurance. In order to get the pdf list above, one must first apply to the online, tuition free school, University of the People.  That way, we can guarantee that if a student doesn’t get a full ride to any of my schools, they will at least have University of the People!</div>

        <p class="paragraph-39">Now for the 3rd and most important component; the scholarship algorithm.Once a student entered their data, they would be given a list of scholarships they automatically qualify for as well as some local scholarships that they qualify for. A PDF is generated for each student as shown below of certain rules and it includes schools with FA awards, University of the people’s awards, and typical local, merit aid awards. The app was designed to include automatic full rides such as Parieview A&amp;M’s Full tuition scholarship was a 21 on the ACT and a GPA of 3.25 weighted GPA. That way since 21 ACT is the top 40%, nearly any students should be able to use the app (and top 60% of Texas exam takers ) most people should win awards to schools like PVAMU. They were also given a custom made .Csv or .xls file that would help them manage which local scholarships to apply to in a regular amount of time. It also predicted how to prioritize scholarship and which scholarships were truly valuable based on their statistical odds of winning were.</p>

    <div id="w-node-278b21ada8e9-dcfce7eb" class="text-block-4">This app was my very first major coding assignment and it taught me the raw power of coding. The main lesson I learned though was that even though this app was EXTREMELY effective, it was hard to get very many people to try it. This came down to how complicated the information I was displaying was. My friends all found the system easy to use, but this app wasn’t designed for people uneducated in basic tools such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets or for people that didn’t hold a computer in their home.My biggest mistake with this term and this project was the fact I didn&#x27;t design a solution that was made for my target audience. From this app forward, I was sure to always design my products with a user in mind.This app will NOT be downloadable. The application is only effective if it is used by Garland High School Students only. But I do encourage people in other cities to create their own versions. If you would like my help on starting your own app for your city/school I can give you my experience and documentation as well as help you find the first 100 scholarships personally! I have helped 8 schools so far create their own programs. You can get it from me by contacting me. <br> </div>
